This code contains three functions that check whether a given input is of a certain type: integar_error(), string_error(), and Double_error().

The integar_error() function checks whether the input is an integer (a whole number like 1, 2, or 3) by trying to convert the input to an integer. If it can convert it to an integer without any errors, it returns "True", which means that the input is an integer. If it can't convert it to an integer, it returns "False", which means that the input is not an integer.

The string_error() function checks whether the input is a string (a piece of text like "hello" or "world") by trying to convert the input to a string. If it can convert it to a string without any errors, it returns "True", which means that the input is a string. If it can't convert it to a string, it returns "False", which means that the input is not a string.

The Double_error() function checks whether the input is a double or a float (a decimal number like 1.5 or 2.7) by trying to convert the input to a float. If it can convert it to a float without any errors, it returns "True", which means that the input is a double or a float. If it can't convert it to a float, it returns "False", which means that the input is not a double or a float.

These functions can be used to check whether an input is of the correct data type before performing operations on it, which can be helpful for preventing errors in a program.
